# python_practice
The aim of this project is to write some code snippets and programs in Python.

1. **binarySeach**: This is an efficient search to find an item in a sorted list. This search is implemented based on divide-and-conquer approach.
2. **quickSort**: Following the divide-and-conquer theme, the quickSort works based on this approach. In this snippet, the algorithm will choose the last element as a pivot and doing partitioning until the pivot is at its correct position. At this point, on the left of the pivot, it contains number(s) that are smaller that the pivot, on the right of the pivot, it contains number(s) that are bigger that the pivot. The function will call itself to sort the left part then right part untill they arra is sorted.
